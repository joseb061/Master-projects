- Executing main program: depending on the algorithm you want to run, 
            uncomment the code below the name of each one. The last part of the program 
            is simply to make an analysis using different
            sigma and ro values. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO RUN ! 

            gcc deterministic.c -o out.exe
